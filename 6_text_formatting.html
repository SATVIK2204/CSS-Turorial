        <h2>Another One</h2>
        <h3>Third way</h3>
        <p>I recently upgraded my PC thanks to some encouragement from my French bulldog, Remy. Turns out there are only so many times a 37-pound dog can enthusiastically slam his bodyweight into a desktop tower before something stops working.

            Only my graphics card suffered irreparable damage, but since I’d already been thinking of upgrading prior to Remy’s mishap, I decided to go ahead and upgrade most of my components (including my motherboard and CPU) anyway. This particular PC hadn’t been upgraded in years and was starting to show its age—fans running non-stop, games and programs crashing, etc. I had already been running diagnostics and tweaking various settings for months, but I was procrastinating pulling my PC out from under my desk until Remy forced my hand.
